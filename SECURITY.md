# Security Policy

If you find a security vulnerability in this project, please report it using one of the following methods:

1. **Preferred**: Use GitHub Security Advisories (via the repository "Security" tab) to file a private vulnerability report.
2. **Email**: Send a detailed report to **support@dyan.live** with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report".
3. **Alternative**: Open a new issue titled "Security Report" so maintainers can triage it. If you need a private response, state that in the issue and maintainers will convert it to a private disclosure or advise next steps.

Please include as much detail as you can about the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and affected versions.

Suggested process

1. Include: steps to reproduce, versions, environment, and any PoC code
2. Give maintainers reasonable time to respond and remediate before disclosing publicly

We will respond in a timely manner and publish a coordinated disclosure if appropriate.
