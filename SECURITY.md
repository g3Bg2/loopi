# Security Policy

If you find a security vulnerability in this project, please report it using GitHub's built-in security features:

Preferably, use GitHub Security Advisories (via the repository "Security" tab) to file a private vulnerability report.
Alternatively, open a new issue titled "Security Report" so maintainers can triage it. If you need a private response, state that in the issue and maintainers will convert it to a private disclosure or advise next steps.

Please include as much detail as you can about the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and affected versions.

Suggested process

1. Include: steps to reproduce, versions, environment, and any PoC code
2. Give maintainers reasonable time to respond and remediate before disclosing publicly

We will respond in a timely manner and publish a coordinated disclosure if appropriate.
