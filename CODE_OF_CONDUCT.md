# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Automa is dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone.

Be respectful, considerate, and professional. Harassment and abusive behavior are not tolerated.

Standards

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community

Reporting

Report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers via GitHub. To report an incident:

- Open a new issue in this repository and include "CODE OF CONDUCT REPORT" in the title so maintainers can triage it quickly.
- If you need confidentiality, use GitHub's Security Advisories feature (if available) or mention in the issue that you'd like a private response — maintainers will convert the report to a private disclosure when appropriate.

If you're unsure how to proceed, open an issue and maintainers will assist you.

This project follows the Contributor Covenant v2.0. Full text: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html
