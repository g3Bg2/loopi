## Developer Notes

- **Tailwind / PostCSS**: The renderer UI uses Tailwind CSS processed via PostCSS. The canonical PostCSS config is `postcss.config.cjs` (CommonJS). There is also a small ESM re-export `postcss.config.js` present so tooling that expects ESM can still read the configuration. If you update Tailwind or PostCSS plugins, update `tailwind.config.cjs` `content` globs so utilities are generated.

- **Formatting & Linting (Biome)**: We use Biome for formatting and linting. Run the formatter/linter before committing with:

```bash
pnpm format
```

Enable the Biome VS Code extension for on-save formatting where available.
